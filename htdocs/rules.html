    <div class="chesschamp">

        <p>Chess pieces are divided into 2 different colored sets, referred to as the black and white pieces. Each set consists of 16 pieces, 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Bishops, 2 Horses, 2 Rooks, and 8 Pawns</p><br> 

        <p>The game is played on an 8x8 checkered board, 8 rows called ranks and 8 columns called files. The squares are referred to as the light and dark squares.</p> <br> 
        
        <p>On white's first rank, from left to right, the pieces are placed in the order: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, horse, rook. And on the second rank the row of pawns are placed. Black's pieces mirrors white's.</p> <br>

    <div class="chesschamp">

        <p>When a king is attacked it is considered to be in check. A move considered to be legal while in check must need to result in a position where the king is no longer in check. This can be done by capturing the attacking piece, blocking by putting a piece between the king and the attacking piece, or by moving the king to a safe square.</p><br>
        <p>The objective of the game is put the opponent's king in checkmate; it occurs when the king is in check and there is no legal way to get it out of check. It is never legal to make a move that endanger's your king. It's common to announce "check" when playing to avoid illegal moves.</p><br>

    <div class="chesschamp">

        <p>King: Moves one square in any direction. </p><br> 

        <p>Queen: Moves any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal. It cannot leap over other pieces.</p> <br> 
        
        <p>Rook: Moves any number of squares along a rank or file. It cannot leap over other pieces.</p> <br>
        
        <p>Bishop: Moves any number of squares along a diagonal. It cannot leap over other pieces.</p> <br>
		
		<p>Horse: Moves in an "L" shape 2 squares and then 1 square. It can leap over other pieces. </p> <br>
		
		<p>Pawn: Moves forward one square if unoccupied, on its first move it can move forward 2 squares if both unoccupied. It captures one square diagonally in front of it.</p><br>

	<div class="v">Time Control</div>
    <img id="v1" src="../images/time.jpg" alt="Chess Clock">
    <div class="chesschamp">

        <p>In competitive play, games are played with a time control. If a player's time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost provided that the opponent has enough pieces to deliver a checkmate.</p><br> 

        <p>The duration of games varies from classical games played for hours up to days, to bullet chess which is played in just minutes.</p> <br> 
        
        <p>The time is controlled by a chess clock which has 2 displays, one for each player's remaining time.</p> <br>
