    <div class="v">Opening</div>
    <div class="chesschamp">

        <p>The opening are the very first moves of a game, recognizable sequences of moves are referred to as openings which have their own names and goals. Such is the reti opening which is quite slow but if played correctly makes your defense impenetrable and Gambits which are early on sacrifices to provide a lot of opportunities of attack while the king is still in the center, unprotected.

	<div class="v">Middlegame</div>
    <div class="chesschamp">

        <p>The middlegame is next and it starts when pieces are developed and put out to challenge for the center of the board. This is the time where players show off their prowess by using tactics and strategy in unique positions to give them the advantage. Tactics are short-term plans, combinations of such maneuvers are the key to get the advantage in a position. Certain moves force opponents to fall into your traps. While strategy is more concerned with long-term plans, every part of the game is important and to have a clear plan at all times is necessary.

	<div class="v">Endgame</div>
    <div class="chesschamp">

        <p>The endgame is the most important part of the game, when there are few pieces left on the board, players memorize and practice patterns to out maneuver their enemy 1 last time to finally secure a win. Great players would be able to convert a winning endgame into a win, and if their opponent is not strong enough, they might be able to get a tie from a losing position.</p><br>
