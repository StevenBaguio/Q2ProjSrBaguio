    <div class="chesschamp">

        <p>Chess Organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo. Players who reach certain milestones are awarded lifetime titles by FIDE. Grandmaster the highest title a player can attain apart from World Champion, requires a minimum of 2500 elo rating and "norms" which are gotten when you travel internationally and are able to beat players who are already grandmasters. Internation Master's conditions are similar to GM apart from the minimum elo rating being 2400, FIDE Master is achieved by having a rating of 2300+ and candidate master who needs a rating of atleast 2200. There are also separate women's titles which require 200 elo rating points lower compared to their counterpart.  </p><br>
