        <p>Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a checker board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each player has a King, a Queen, 2 Bishops, 2 Horses, 2 Rooks, and 8 Pawns, and the objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king. </p> <br> </div>
